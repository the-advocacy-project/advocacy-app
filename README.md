This has been designed mobile first.


- An MVP web application created under the umbrella of the *Founders & Coders* cohort 15 Tech-For-Better scheme 
- Made in collaboration with *The Advocacy Project*, this application allows vulnerable adults in Hackney, London to collect the evidence they need to trigger an assessment for care and support under the Care Act 2014. An email with their information is sent directly to the Local Authority as well as to *The Advocacy Project*, thereby streamlining the process of triggering duty.
