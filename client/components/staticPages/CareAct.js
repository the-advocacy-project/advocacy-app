                <p>
                    The Care Act 2014 sets out in one place, local authorities’
                    duties in relation to assessing people’s needs and their
                    eligibility for publicly funded care and support.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Under the Care Act 2014, local authorities must:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            carry out an assessment of anyone who appears to
                            require care and support, regardless of their likely
                            eligibility for state-funded care
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            focus the assessment on the person’s needs and how
                            they impact on their wellbeing, and the outcomes
                            they want to achieve
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            involve the person in the assessment and, where
                            appropriate, their carer or someone else they
                            nominate provide access to an independent advocate
                            to support the person’s involvement in the
                            assessment if required.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            provide access to an independent advocate to support
                            the person’s involvement in the assessment if
                            required.
                        </li>
