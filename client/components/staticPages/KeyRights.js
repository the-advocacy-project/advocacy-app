                       Where it appears to a local authority that an adult may have needs for care and
                       support, the authority must assess </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>whether the adult does have needs for care and support, and</li>
                        <li>if the adult does, what those needs are</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The local authority have a duty to provide support if three requirements are met:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your needs must be the result of a physical or mental impairment or illness</li>
                        <li>As a result, you must be unable to achieve two or more of the outcomes set out in the
                        eligibility criteria</li>
                        <li>As a consequence, there is likely to be a significant impact on your wellbeing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <li>The duty to provide a Care Act advocate</li>
                    <p>S. 67 Care Act 2014:
                        <br/><br/>
                    The local authority must arrange an independent care act advocate to facilitate the involvement
                    of a person in their assessment, in the preparation of their care and support plan and in the
                    review of their care plan, if two conditions are met:
                        <br/> <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>that if an independent advocate were not provided the person would have substantial
                            difficulty in being fully involved in these processes, and </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>that there is no appropriate individual available to support and represent the person’s
                            wishes who is not paid or professionally engaged in providing care or treatment to the person or their carer. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                    The independent care act advocate also has a legal duty to assist the individual in challenging decisions made by the
                    local authority, if the individual wishes.
