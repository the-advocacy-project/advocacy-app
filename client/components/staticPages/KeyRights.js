                <li>The duty to provide a Care Act advocate</li>
                <p>S. 67 Care Act 2014:
                <br/><br/>
                The local authority must arrange an independent care act advocate to facilitate the involvement 
                of a person in their assessment, in the preparation of their care and support plan and in the 
                review of their care plan, if two conditions are met: 
                <br/> <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>that if an independent advocate were not provided the person would have substantial 
                        difficulty in being fully involved in these processes, and </li>
                        <br/>
                    <li>that there is no appropriate individual available to support and represent the person’s 
                        wishes who is not paid or professionally engaged in providing care or treatment to the person or their carer. </li>
                </ul>
                <br/> 
                The independent care act advocate also has a legal duty to assist the individual in challenging decisions made by the 
                local authority, if the individual wishes.
